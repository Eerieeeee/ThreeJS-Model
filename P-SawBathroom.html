        <h3>SAW Bathroom</h3>
    
      <h4>Wash Away Your Sin</h4>
        <p>
          <br>
          During my <strong>free time between projects</strong> I wanted to make something that was just for me. So on and off for a month or so, whenever I had some free time I would try and
          make some more progress on this little side project of mine.<br>
          <br>
          One horror movie franchise that <strong>I really love is SAW</strong>. One of my friends that I play horror games with convinced me to <strong>go back and rewatch all of the movies</strong> a few years ago. I'd already watched a handful but, out of order and not all of them, so I had 
          always just <strong>assumed</strong> they were sort of, <strong>one-off movies</strong> and that was kind of it. Well I was pleasantly surprised on my rewatching of them all in order to see the whole story and <strong>experience all the twists properly</strong>,
           all which I had <strong>long forgotten!</strong> Since then 
          I developed a <strong>strong appreciation for the series</strong>, it's more than some horror torture movie, there's a lot of fun going on in the narrative too!<br>
          <strong>The Bathroom</strong> will forever be such an <strong>iconic location</strong> in the series so I felt it was the best place to try and recreate.<br>

          <br>

          <h5>Environment</h5><p><br>
            For me, the modelling side of this project was about being as <strong>accurate to the source</strong> as possible and I believe I achieved this. I really put in the time and effort in order to recreate the scene as accurately as possible, trying to
            create any <strong>damage or breaks</strong> in the environment just how they appear in the movie. I even went as far to <strong>learn the names of certain pipe valves</strong> in order to find better reference images so that I was able to
             model them correctly, as I couldn't get a clear shot of them in the movie.<br>
          <br>
        
          <br>
          <h5>Textures</h5><p><br>
            I thought this could be an <strong>interesting oppurtunity/experiment</strong>, to see how well I could <strong>hand paint</strong> the dirt, grime and dust textures that can be seen around the environment.<br>
            It is something that I had never tried and I wondered if there was anything I could learn from trying this. In my aims to recreate the scene, <strong></strong>hand painting
            these textures was the best idea as I could see <strong>how each brush stroke changed the texture</strong>, allowing me to very closely create the textures.
            After this project I was inclined to learn how to <strong>create custom brushes from images on GIMP</strong> which has become incredibly useful for me!<br>
            <br>
            If I had sourced the grime and dirt decals online, the decals would've looked more realistic, however none of them would have <strong>accurately recreated the marks</strong> in the original scene.<br>           
          <br>

            <img src="Images/Saw/SawComparison.jpg" style="border-radius: 15px;">
          </a><br>

            Here is a side by side comparison of the original scene and my final render.<br>
          <br>

          I am most happy with the floor and the back wall when it comes to the decals, I feel that the textures on the back wall successfully look like water damage around the pipes.<br>

              <br>
              Areas that I believe that I did well on during the process of this project;<br>
                    
              <br>
                <li class="bullet list">Considering the majority of the heavy lifting of this scene is the textures, I feel that I was successful in achieving what I set out to.
                  Between the hand painted textures, giving me <strong>absolute control</strong> over the shape and placement of the dirt and grime, the <strong>displacement maps used to allow the blood and dirt </strong>to sit in 
                  the grooves of the tiles in the bathroom all came together really well in my opinion and I am really happy with the result.<br>
                </li><br>

              <p>
              <br>
              These are some areas that I believe I could improve upon.<br>

              <br>
              <li class="bullet list">While I am happy with the outcome of this project, I feel that the rust textures for the pipes and bathtub could be a lot better, I was overly focused on getting the dirt and grime accurate, I neglected this specific material. 
                 I think if I reduced the noise on the textures and perhaps added some hand painted dust that would sit on the pipes quite naturally would be better suited than the texture they currently have.
              </li><br>

              <br>
              <li class="bullet list">I have spent some time learning GIMP since doing this project and now have the knowledge to create my own brush textures, with this I would be able to create better and more realistic hand painted textures for
                this project.<br>              
              </li><br>
