              <h3>Horror Narrative Experience</h3>
              
              <h4>Using Environmental Storytelling to convey a Narrative and build Tension</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                My <strong>Dissertation Project</strong> was carried out throughout the entirety of my <strong>Fourth</strong> year at University.
                I was given the option to create a <strong>short project</strong> alongside my Dissertation that would allow me to
                <strong>support the research</strong> section of my disseration. As testing was a part of the dissertation, I could either use
                an already made game or create my own. I decided to create my own project so that I could <strong>accurately</strong> try to represent
                the ideas and concepts laid out in my <strong>Literature Review</strong>, which had a focus on <strong>Environmental Storytelling</strong> as a 
                <strong>Tool</strong> within <strong>Horror Games</strong>, and test their effectiveness through the use of participants
                who volunteered to take part in playing the short experience.<br>
                Throughout the year I <strong>researched</strong> and <strong>collected</strong> information relating to my topic, using a variety of sources,
                and began to plan out a project design that was <strong>influenced</strong> by the information i gathered. The information helped 
                me decide on attributes of the project such as <strong>pacing</strong>, <strong>location</strong>, <strong>lighting</strong>, <strong>colour</strong> and more.<br>
              </p>
              <br>

              <p>
                <br>
                <strong>Genre:</strong> <i>Horror, Storytelling, Walking-Sim</i><br>
                <strong>Engine:</strong> <i>Unity</i><br>
                <strong>Development Period:</strong> <i>Approx 1 month</i><br>
                <strong>Platform:</strong> <i>PC</i><br>
                           
                <br>
                <h4>Art Direction</h4><br>                
                <h5>Inspiration</h5><br>
                <p>
                The <strong>initial project</strong> idea had been inspired by the <i><strong>P.T</strong> (Konami Productions)</i> with the same hallway & apartment repeating
                itself and <strong>slowly changing</strong> over time. I wanted the story to <strong>convey</strong> the <strong>mind</strong> of the character that the player would be
                controlling. The <strong>environment</strong> would be a <strong>physical representation</strong> of the <strong>character's psyche</strong>, slowly spiralling as they come to terms with the 
                horrible things that they had done.<br>
                On each subsequent layer, things around the apartment and hallway would change <strong>slowly feeding</strong> the player more information
                about <strong>the narrative</strong>.<br>
                <br>

                <img class="small-img" src="Images/Dissertation/PT-Concept.jpg" alt="PT References" style=" border-radius: 15px;"><br>     
                <i><strong>P.T Demo</strong> (2014)</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An early sketched concept<br>

                <br>
                However due to the <strong>short</strong> amount of extra time I had to dedicate to this project I had to take my initial idea and <strong>condense</strong> the scope
                down to a more <strong>managable size</strong> given the time period. With this in mind I <strong>planned</strong> out all of the <strong>potential rooms</strong> that I could
                use and this allowed me to <strong>remove excess</strong> if needed, <strong>planning ahead</strong> to best suit the time frame that I had for the project.<br>

                <br>
                <h5>Environment</h5>

                <br>
                <img src="Images/Dissertation/Concept2.jpg" alt="Apartment Concept" style="border-radius: 15px;"><br>
                
                <p>
                <br>
                Using a mix of reference images of small apartments, sources from my life and also taking inspiration from <i><strong>P.T</strong> (Konami Productions)</i>, 
                I was able to create a couple of rooms for the apartment and then began to work on the <strong>Red Room</strong>. The Red Room would replace the bathroom and become the
                <strong>final room</strong> that the participant would enter, completing the <strong>whole picture</strong> of what had happened in the apartment and in the city that the apartment was
                based in.<br>

                <br>
                <img src="Images/Dissertation/LivingRoom1.jpg" alt="Living Room Render" style="border-radius: 15px;"><br>

                <br>
                For the Red Room and the models that were in it, I drew inspiration from a few sources, <i><strong>Gotham</strong> (2018)</i> was a large 
                inspiration for the actions of the Killer and what they did. With the room itself drawing inspiration from sources like <i><strong>The Evil Within</strong> (Tango Gameworks)</i>
                and also from <i><strong>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</strong> (Capcom)</i>. Trying to use models to show that people were captured, brought here and then kept alive, potentially
                tortured and then killed.<br>

                <br>
                <img src="Images/Dissertation/RedRoomInspo.jpg" alt="Red Room Moodboard" style="border-radius: 15px;"><br>

                <br>
                Also using <strong>literature sources</strong>, the decision to make the room red was based upon two separate sources from my literature review. <i><strong>"Red stimulates the physical and adrenalin. It 
                raises blood pressure, heart rate and respiration."</strong> (O'Connor. Z, 2011)</i> & another source that spoke in depth about how <i><strong>"red can be inviting and is used in marketing as the 
                warmth of red is alluring, but it can also represent danger as certain red things in nature are dangerous to eat and may also indicate anger."</strong> (Humphery. N, 1976).</i><br>
                With this knowledge, red was used as a way to lure the player into the room and once they step around a tarp blocking their view, they realise that this is a dangerous place to be.<br>

              <p>
                <br>
                <h4>Documentation</h4><br>

                <br>
                
                <h5>Project Purpose</h5><br>
                <p>
                The <strong>intention</strong> of this project was to <strong>create a short horror narrative experience</strong> using a basis of information about <strong>environmental storytelling</strong> 
                and it's uses within the <strong>horror genre</strong>. It had <strong>relevant</strong> and <strong>backed references</strong> to help <strong>plan and design</strong> the project.
                After the project had been completed, <strong>participants</strong> were recruited and split into <strong>two separate test groups</strong> who played slightly
                different versions of the project and afterwards had to <strong>fill out</strong> a <strong>questionnaire</strong> about the experience.<br>
                With the intention of having the <strong>data collected</strong> from the participants be able to <strong>inform</strong> on the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of certain <strong>implementations</strong>
                with a primary focus on environmental storytelling, but also touching upon sound, light and the tension and release cycle aswell.<br>


                <br>
                <h5>Layout of the Experience - The Hallway</h5><br>
                <p>
                With the research gathered, I learned that <strong>grounding a player</strong> in their <strong>environment</strong> within the first <strong>few seconds</strong> of starting is very important
                to <strong>help immerse</strong> them into the experience quickly. So to help with this the start of the hallway was kept to help build up a <strong>familiar setting</strong> and 
                also the <strong>tension</strong>, using it as a section to quickly let the player know where they are and then begin to <strong>prime them</strong> for what lies ahead.<br>
                
                <br>
                <img src="Images/Dissertation/Hallway.jpg" alt="Apartment Layout" style="border-radius:15px;"><br>
                
                <br>
                <h5>The Apartment</h5><br>
                <p>
                After walking down the hall a little, the <strong>lights go out</strong> and <strong>footsteps</strong> can be heard running overhead. The <strong>door</strong> to the apartment further down the hall
                <strong>swings open</strong>, letting some light out. A common technique used in games is <strong>using lighting</strong> to help tell players <strong>where they have to go</strong> next without explicitly
                telling them. This technique was used in this project to help guide player from room to room, and to keep the <strong>tensions high</strong> as there are many <strong>dark corners</strong>
                in the apartment and <strong>distant noises</strong> can be heard throughout the environment.<br>

                <br>
                <img src="Images/Dissertation/Hallway2.jpg" alt="Apartment Light in the Hallway" style="border-radius: 15px;"> <br>

                <br>
                Once the player enters the apartment, after a short period the front door will <strong>slam shut</strong> and remain closed for the rest of the experience, <strong>trapping</strong> the player
                inside.<br>

                <br>
                From here the player will then have time to <strong>explore</strong> first the <strong>Kitchen</strong> and then the <strong>Living Room</strong>, looking around the environment taking time to digest any 
                information they come across. Once they explore the 2 rooms, the <strong>lights will go out</strong> and a <strong>hidden door</strong> into the <strong>Red Room</strong> will creak open, luring them deeper 
                into the apartment.<br>

                <br>
                <h5>Texturing the Red Room</h5><br>
                <p>
                There is an idea that, when it comes to <strong>Narcissists</strong> and their <strong>failed relationships</strong>, they tend to <strong>keep trophies</strong> from these relationships as another method 
                to continue their <strong>self-enhancement</strong>. They will hold onto objects from their relationships with <strong>high status</strong> partners to <strong>prove</strong> their <strong>self worth</strong>. 
                Whether this be <strong>true or not</strong>, I found it to be an <strong>interesting</strong> concept.<br>
                For this part of the project I spent a lot of time in <strong>Photoshop</strong> creating textures for <strong>newspaper clippings</strong>, editing <strong>images of people</strong> to display as Victims in 
                the <strong>Killers trophy box</strong>. I used Pittsburgh as the setting for the project and went on Google Maps to find <strong>real places</strong>, pin-point them on my map and label them things like "Her House", "Her Work" etc, to imply
                that the Killer had been <strong>stalking their victims beforehand</strong>.<br>
                On top of this I also used an image of an old Pittsburgh Post-Gazette newspaper and then edited it to write my own stories over it to <strong>create multiple short stories</strong> about what had happened to
                previous victims to improve the <strong>world building</strong> in the project. The aim of using a real life city and finding imagery to edit from that city was to add some <strong>versimilitude</strong> to the 
                experience.<br>

                <br>
                <img src="Images/Dissertation/TextureProcess.jpg" alt="Photoshopped Images and Textures" style="border-radius: 15px;"><br>
                
                <br>
                The whole purpose of these models was to help convey the narrative to the player and to also emphasise the idea of Narcissists collecting trophies and displaying them to prove
                their worth.<br>
            
                <br>
                <h4>Unity Implementation</h4><br>
                <h5>Initial Steps</h5><br>
                <p>
                After finalising my 3D models I then exported everything and imported it into Unity.
                I created a character controller and began to animate certain key points in the environment to help
                the player keep moving and exploring as well as to keep them on edge while playing. Doing my best to keep my
                design in line with my research, for example;<br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li class="bullet list"><strong>Instilling a fear of the unknown</strong> within the player - Not letting them see the "monster" or know where or what it is, only hinting at these things.</li><br>
                  <li class="bullet list">Not giving the player the whole picture - Letting them <strong>fill in the blanks</strong> and draw connections from what they see.</li><br>
                  <li class="bullet list">Using <strong>vision as a mechanic</strong> - Having lights turn off and on to help guide the player through the ;project but also to help keep the tensions high.</li><br>
                  <li class="bullet list">Having the "monster" off screen can build <strong>tension and suspense</strong> - People are afraid of things that they don't know or understand, especially when 
                    they don't know where they are.</li><br>
                  <li class="bullet list">Using <strong>Colour Theory</strong> to help create feelings of danger - Looking at simple colour theory and understanding how certain colours help elicit certain feelings 
                    within people.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

                <br>
                <h5>Additional Atmospheric Details</h5><br>
                <p>
                Having the project set at <strong>night</strong> with some <strong>rain</strong>, I used a skybox of a city and also created a rain particle system and also tried to create <strong>atmospheric sounds</strong> around the apartment in order 
                to make it <strong>feel more grounded</strong>. Some subtle noises, like <strong>rain hitting the windows</strong>, occassional footsteps else where in the building and more.
              </p>

              <p>
               <br>
               <h5>Creating the Control Group</h5><br>
               <p>
                To help introduce a <strong>control group</strong> to aid with telling how effective the Narrative elements were in
                the project, I created a <strong>small pop up</strong> that would appear showing the player <strong>information about certain
                objects</strong> if they were close to them and also looking in their direction. This pop up was <strong>only visible</strong> in  
                <strong>Group A.</strong><br>
                <strong>Group B</strong> had <strong>no pop up</strong>  and received no additional information throughout their playthrough.<br>

                Areas that I believe that I did well on during the process of this project;<br>
                  
                <br>
                <li class="bullet list">At the start of the project, with having to <strong>manage multiple projects</strong> at once thoughout the year, I took into consideration the amount of time they would all take
                  and understood that I would need to <strong>plan ahead</strong> incase the scope of the projects turned out to be too large.<br> I did this by having <strong>multiple rooms</strong> that could be 
                  <strong>added or removed</strong> depending on the <strong>progress of all of the projects</strong>. This allowed me to create work that I am proud of and still make a cohesive experience. 
                </li><br>
                
                <li class="bullet list">This was the <strong>first time</strong> that I had created a project <strong>using in-depth research</strong> to <strong>inform my creative decisions</strong> and help me 
                  structure an experience that would be <strong>successful in scaring a player</strong>. I feel that I was successful with what I set out to achieve for this project and I believe that this <strong>actually 
                    improved</strong> the overall experience of the project.
                </li><br>
          
                <li class="bullet list">I was successful with my <strong>division of work</strong> across this project. Compared to previous years and projects, when it came to this project I made sure that I gave equal
                  amounts of attention to the 3DS Max side of things, as well as the Unity and coding side too. Ensuring that the experience was as complete as possible and to a high standard that I was proud of.
                </li><br>
              </p>

              <p>
                <br>
                These are some areas that I believe I could improve upon.<br>

                <br>
                <li class="bullet list">I was <strong>incredibly passionate</strong> about this project. However with this, it took a lot of my attention and priority and since I was working on multiple
                  projects at the one time, <strong>this project took priority</strong> over the others, when I should have put <strong>equal effort into all of them</strong>. Going forward I will have to learn to not let this
                  happen and that I should give each project the same attention to detail.

                <li class="bullet list">Unfortunately, due to the limited time that I had in order to create this project, I wasn't able to create all of the content that I wish that I could
                  have. I understand that some of the Environmental Storytelling that I created was a bit <i>on the nose</i>, however I know that I tried to make the best that I could with the given time.<br>
                  I am completely aware of the fact that there are some areas that can be improved as well as better ways that the narrative could have been conveyed to the player in a <strong>more subtle</strong> and 
                  natural manner.
                </li><br>

                <li class="bullet list">Sometimes, with my aims of creating a high standard of work, it can lead to me being caught up in <strong>over-working minor and unimportant details</strong>,
                  especially with my modelling. I have to learn how not be so concerned with details that would tend to be over looked and focus on the key models first. If I had been
                  able to do this, there is the possibility that it would have to allowed me to create m ore of the desired content that I had for this project.
