      <h3>Penguino Race</h3>
    
      <h4>The Arduino Penguin Platformer!</h4><br>
        <p>
          Each year there was a <strong>
            
          </strong> between the different year groups, where we were split off into groups to make a <strong>short game and build an Arduino controller</strong> to use alongside the project, this 
          was typically a much <strong>smaller project</strong> than the rest of our projects as it <strong>ran alongside 2 of our larger projects in the first semester.</strong><br>
          In my third year at university our group created a <strong>platformer game</strong> and also a <strong>controller using an Arduino Kit.</strong> Each group member had to <strong>make their own level</strong> and the 
          player had to go from one end of the level to another trying to <strong>stay on platforms and collect powerups to aid them.</strong> The player had to <strong>beat the clock</strong> in order to pass the level!<br>

            <h4>Art Direction</h4><p>
            <br>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5><p><br>
            Each group was <strong>decided by votes to certain topics</strong> that each student wanted to do, we had a first and second choice. One of mine was <strong>Indie Games</strong> and that was the group I got put into.
            So, using <strong>Miro to help brainstorm our ideas,</strong> our group began by collecting a bunch of games from <strong>Steam and also Itch.io</strong> that were Indie Games as you can see in the image below. 
            During our research into Indie Games, we noted that the most popular genres were; <strong>3D, Retro, Singleplayer, Adventure, Horror and Platforming.</strong><br>

            <br>
            <img src="Images/Penguino/MiroBoard.jpg" alt="Render of the Main Menu Background for Penguino" style=" border-radius: 15px;"><br>
            <i>We used colour coded stars in order to vote on which games we personally liked for our potential inspiration.</i><br>

            <br>
            We took note that the <strong>majority of our votes went to platforming games</strong> and we were heading towards a <strong>darker aesthetic like Limbo</strong> for our game until someone suggested 
            making it <strong>Christmas themed since it was December at the time.</strong> We then started trying to find inspiration for games that had <strong>snowy environments</strong> and began to make a moodboard 
            out of them all. We were inspired by old platforming games like <strong>Mario 64, Crash Bandicoot</strong> and some others, taking inspiration from their snow levels too!<br>

            <br>
            <img src="Images/Penguino/Inspirations.jpg" alt="Render of the Main Menu Background for Penguino" style=" border-radius: 15px;"><br>
            <i>This is the Moodboard that I complied at the time.</i><br>

            <br>
            <h5>Environment</h5><p><br>
            With the moodboard above and other imagery that the group members had collected, we came up with the idea that the player would be a <strong>Penguin trying to deliver letters to Igloos,</strong> this gave a 
            reason to <strong>avoid the water</strong> that would be in our levels as the <strong>letters would be ruined.</strong> The player would have to navigate <strong>across ice and other platforms</strong> avoiding 
            the water below, some of the platforms would <strong>break after a few seconds</strong> of the player standing on them.<br>

            <br>
            <img src="Images/Penguino/Concept_003.jpg" alt="Render of the Main Menu Background for Penguino" style=" border-radius: 15px;"><br>
            <i>A rough concept layout of what my level would look like.</i><br>

            <br>
            The goal of the player is to <strong>reach the end of the level within the given time limit,</strong> as each level would have a specific time that they had to beat otherwise they would fail. While the controls 
            remained the same across each level, we had designed it so that <strong>each group member could decide if their level was Top Down or a more 3rd person camera position.</strong><br>
            For the game, we all decided to go for a <strong>low poly style</strong> since a lot of our inspiration came from <strong>retro style platformers.</strong> My level was the last level in the game, since I was in 
            3rd year (the longest student), which meant that it also had to be the <strong>hardest level</strong> of the game. Since there was a timer, I decided to make some <strong>Ice Walls</strong> that would split up the 
            environment like a Maze and also have lots of smaller platforms for the player to jump across as well. To ensure it wasn't too difficult, I made sure that there was <strong>no dead ends</strong> and that the 
            maze was relatively <strong>simple to navigate!</strong><br>

            <br>
            <h5>Project Purpose</h5><p><br>
            The main intention of this project is to get students together in slightly larger groups than they are used to, <strong>interacting with people outside of their normal circles</strong> to allow them to develop 
            their <strong>creative and also their collaborative skills with others.</strong> This was an opportunity for students from different years to <strong>share their knowledge and experience</strong> with others.<br>
            The second focus of this project is for the students to develop their skills with <strong>Physical Computing and make Arduino controllers</strong> for their games. During the 8 weeks of this projects students 
            attend <strong>physical computing classes</strong> and also use <strong>Tinkercad exercises</strong> to learn how to use <strong>Arduino Boards and Circuits.</strong> You are allowed to use whatever 
            <strong>Sensors and Actuators</strong> you want when making your controller.

            <br>
            <h5>Responsibilities</h5><p><br>
            While I believe there may have been some wish for the older students to take a leadership role within the groups, I tried to help set the group up in a way that <strong>we could all share ideas equally </strong>
            and still work together in a way that was <strong>more enjoyable for everyone.</strong> Since the nature of these projects were a bit more <strong>simple, compared to the other projects</strong> that we had on-going
            at the time, myself and the second years were completely comfortable with the level of work that we had to do, however the first years were still learning, so <strong>I offered to help to them throughout the weeks </strong>
            that we worked together on these projects, I would <strong>reach out a couple times a week</strong> to see how they were getting on and if they needed any help we would<strong>talk it over through messages</strong>  on discord 
            or call if they needed to, I took a more <strong>supportive role in these projects.</strong><br>

            <br>
            <h5>Menu Layout</h5><p><br>
            Due to having the most experience in the group, I tried to pick up more of the <strong>extra jobs</strong>, since everyone was designing their own level and were chipping in to ideas and coding, I took responsibility 
            for <strong>creating the menu and linking all of the levels for each person,</strong> so that they wouldn't have to worry about it and could focus on their work better. Since I'd already had to make a few menus for my 
            projects over the years it was no hassle for me to set up, I also <strong>designed the background assets for the main menu aswell.</strong><br>

            <h5>The Arduino</h5><p><br>
            Part of the Learning Outcome for this project was to <strong>develop skills in physical computing </strong>and this was done by creating a physical controller to be used to play the game with an Arduino board and circuitry.
            Before creating our controller, our group first set out to<strong> define what our mechanics would be in the game</strong> as this would <strong>inform the design of our controller</strong> and what we were going to add to it.<br>

            <h4>Self-Reflection</h4><p>
            
            <br>
            Areas that I believe that I did well on during the process of this project;<br>
              
            <br>
            <li class="bullet list">I believe that my biggest strength in this project was taking on a <strong>supportive role instead of a managerial one,</strong> not only was I working on my own level, the main menu and doing my share of
              the coding, but also ensuring that I made time to <strong>help and support the first years as well,</strong> making sure that they were able to solve any issues that they came across.
            </li><br>
            
            <li class="bullet list">Due to a lot of this project being done online, I used <strong>Miro in a way to make sure everyone had an equal way to share their ideas and thoughts,</strong> usings coloured post-it notes and stars for people
              to <strong>write down ideas</strong> and also to <strong>vote for what inspirations and mechanics</strong> they liked the best.
            </li><br>
      
            <li class="bullet list">I'd never had a leadership role before this and I feel <strong>I was successful in helping the rest of the team come together and be organised as well</strong>  as ensuring that everyone was able to
              complete their work in time for the deadline.
            </li><br>
          </p>

          <p>
            <br>
            These are some areas that I believe I could improve upon.<br>

            <br>
            <li class="bullet list">Due to having to focus on many things at once, I perhaps <strong>leaned on the low-poly style a bit much</strong> and hindsight made me realise that I had the time to increase the amount/quality of my
              assets if <strong>I had been a bit more brave.</strong> I could have done more with my assets than I did, I perhaps played it a little too safe here.
            </li><br>

            <li class="bullet list">Realistically, my desire to create the hardest level led to it becoming the primary focus of my level's design. I feel that it <strong>hampered the overall design of my level</strong> as I know I could have
              been<strong> more creative with the layout and design.</strong>
            </li><br>

            <li class="bullet list">Along with my low-poly style, this could have been a good opportunity for me to create more <strong>stylised textures to fit my low-poly models.</strong> It was a shame that I never considered it at the time,
              leaving my texturing feeling very simple and plain.
            </li><br>
