      <h3>RPD Recreation</h3>
    
      <h4>Remaking the exterior of the RPD from Resident Evil 2</h4><br>
        <p>
          Being a <strong>massive fan</strong> of the Resident Evil games, I really wanted to model an environment from one of that games <strong>to see how well I could recreate it</strong>. I settled on going for 
          the RPD exterior from the remake of <i><strong>Resident Evil 2 </strong>(Capcom, 2019).</i> I believe that this was a good choice for me as the majority of my work before hand is made up of different styled
          <strong>interior environments</strong> and I had never made a <strong>large scale exterior before</strong>. The mix of the <strong>dark night, having a variety of vehicles and also some foliage too</strong>, gave me a variety of modelling
          oppurtunities to experiment with in order to recreate the setting to a high standard.<br>
          A benefit from doing this as well was that I was able to <strong>directly compare myself</strong> to what is a high <strong>industry standard </strong>and see how well I was at meeting this level of quality.<br>
        </p>

              <p>
              Did good job, Looks very alike the source material.
              Small details even to help give some <strong>extra depth</strong> to the closest building on the left. The idea for this came from when I was playing <i><strong>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</strong>(FromSoftware, 2019)</i>, I noticed
              while hanging from certain rock walls, that the main portion of the wall was <strong>flat</strong> but then the <strong>edges had actual modelled rocks</strong> to give the <strong>illusion</strong> that the 
              whole wall had the same amount of depth. This is something <strong>I really enjoy doing while playing games</strong>, in a moment where I can be still and there's no action or anything, 
              <strong>I love to look closer at the models to see how</strong> they made certain things and give the <strong>impression of realism</strong>, so that I can <strong>use these ideas in my own work</strong>.<br>

              <br>
              <h5>Car Modelling</h5><br>
              <p>
              Since my only experience with <strong>modelling vehicles</strong> had been with my Neon City project in third year, I felt like this would be a good opportunity for me to <strong>revisit modelling cars</strong>. I believe overall, 
              about 40% of the modelling time for this project was spent on the vehicles themselves. I spent a lot of time trying to accurately recreate the shape of all the different cars as possible. However 
              despite my best efforts I feel that they all still <strong>look a bit incomplete</strong>, or <strong>not as realistic</strong> as I would like them to be, even though I spent some time learning 
              about modelling vehicles as well as using <strong>Car Paint materials</strong> to try and help the realism of the vehicles.<br>
              <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>Work In Progress Bus Model</i><br>

            
              <br>
              I think one thing that may help improve my vehicles is if I texture them using <strong>real world images</strong> of the cars for things like <strong>headlights, tailights, plates</strong> etc. It might be the missing piece that I need for my vehicles to feel real. I feel that no matter how much I model the 
              vehicles to the best of my abilities, I was never happy with the result of the textures. After this project I will spend some time on <strong>one vehicle and try to recreate</strong> it as realistically as possible as it is an area I need to 
              practice.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              <br>
              <h5>Imagers</h5><br>
              <p>
              I love to <strong>render every so often</strong> as I am modelling and texturing so that I can <strong>see the progress I am making</strong>, as it helps to <strong>keep me motivated</strong> in my work. I noticed 
              that when I reached the lighting stage of the rendering that there was a <strong>lot of noise</strong> between the light and dark areas and I had no idea how to remove it. I spent a little time searching for 
              solutions and <strong>discovered Imagers</strong> and began learning how to use them to <strong>improve the final results of my renders</strong>. Using things such as <strong>Denoiser, Colour Correction, Vignette</strong> 
              and a lot more to <strong>post-process my renders</strong> in engine. I used these Imagers to help create the right exterior look that I wanted.<br>              
              <br>

            </p>

            <p>
              <br>
              <h5>Foliage</h5><br>
              <p>
              The Trees were also a bit of a challenge for me too! I had never tried to create any sort of foliage before, so this was a <strong>bit of an experiment for me</strong>. Trying my best to create something that looks <strong>aesthetically pleasing from a distance.</strong> 
              I feel that from the distance that the trees are viewed from, I was successful in creating the the trees.<br>
              However, in hindsight I've realised I can recreate the <strong>same trees with a smaller poly count</strong> as from this distance, the bends
              in the branches are very hard to see, so I would have been able to have <strong>one single poly for each group of leaves</strong>, rather than <strong>around 8 polys</strong> that have had all their vertices moved to make it look more natural.<br>
              <br>
              This was a good learning oppurtunity for me as I have never really attempted foliage or more natural objects in my work.<br>
              <br>
            </p>

            <p>

              <h4>Self-Reflection</h4><p><br>
              
              <br>
              Areas that I believe that I did well on during the process of this project;<br>
                
              <br>
              <li class="bullet list">Overall really happy with how this turned out and I feel like I was <strong>successful in achieving a high standard</strong> of
                quality for this render. I spent a lot of time making sure I was as <strong>accurate as possible to the source material</strong> as well. As well as being successful it was really fun and motivational to work on something I was so passionate about!<br>
              </li><br>
              
              <li class="bullet list"><strong>Learning about Imagers was beneficial to my work</strong>. I noticed a lot of noise in my renders with the lighting and the shadows. So began to research a way
                to atleast <strong>mitigate most of the noise</strong> and came across Imagers and began to learn how to use them. Imagers ended up doing a lot more for my renders than just reducing the amount
                of noise in them, I learned how to use certain things in <strong>3ds Max</strong> such as <strong>colour correction, vignettes and more</strong>.<br>
                This will help me to a lot of <strong>post processing</strong> things in 3ds Max itself without the need for a second source. However I feel that a second source might be needed even if for just 1 or
                2 aspects.<br>
                With what I learned I was able to go back to my <strong>Saw Render and used some Imagers to help polish up the final render</strong> for it as well which was nice.<br>
              </li><br>
        
            </p>

            <p>
              <br>
              These are some areas that I believe I could improve upon.<br>

              <br>
              <li class="bullet list"><strong>Cars are hard</strong>. Mine are fine and do the job for what I need here, however I would need some practice and then come back to it later on. Perhaps even 
                <strong>remodel my Neon Tank</strong> 
                and take my time to see how it would look now. I did learn a bit about the car paint material in 3ds Max and understand how it's values work to create a nice paint colour, however my car models do need
                work.<br>
                I want to take time outside of this project to <strong>practice and learn how to model better vehicles</strong>.<br>
              </li><br>

              <li class="bullet list">Also while I feel that the trees, from the distant they are in the render are good. I feel that I could still <strong>cut down</strong> the poly count of the leaves as they are quite
                high. (Tree Pun Intended)<br>
                I will continue to learn about foilage and ways to model more organic things in nature.<br> 
              </li><br>

              <li class="bullet list">I feel that perhaps taking my render and trying to <strong>polish it up more in a photo editing software</strong> could be beneficial to my work and is something I want to explore in the near future.<br>
                Adding things like the <strong>rain</strong> and perhaps a <strong>couple of burning vehicles</strong> may have boosted the final render.</i>
