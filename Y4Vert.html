        <h4>A Game of Chance</h4><br>
        <p>
          Running with an identical format to the year prior, this group was even larger than the last due to there now being 4 year groups taking part in the project. Each group had to <strong>design a short 
          game and create an Arduino controller</strong> alongside it that you could play the game on.<br>
          Much like the year before, each student <strong>made their own level</strong> and we came together to <strong>create our controller</strong> and the design of our game. Groups were decided by topics 
          voted for by the students during classes. With our topic, the player is trying to <strong>promote their "game" </strong>and is given the choice between <strong>different cards</strong> in each level. By using 
          <strong>rng to change the cards before each choice</strong>, the outcome will either be a <strong>positive or negative boost to the game's visibility.</strong><br>

          <h4>Art Direction</h4><p>
          <br>
          <h5>Inspiration - Main Menu</h5><p><br>
          My level was inspired by the topic we were given of the <strong>"Games Industry"</strong>. I made a <strong>low poly 3d office</strong> and since I was looking at pixel art <strong>I created pixel UI for the game too.</strong><br>
          For the office, I wanted a very simple and low-poly style as I felt that this would be <strong>the most efficient style</strong> for modelling within the time limit for this project, so that I could 
          <strong>ease the workload</strong> of the students in the years below I would be <strong>designing and modelling the main menu myself as well as my own level.</strong> I began creating a Moodboard
          of different low-poly offices to draw inspiration from. I really like the idea of having a small diorama for the Main Menu.<br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/OfficeInspiration.jpg"><br>
          <i>An Inspiration Board that I created.</i><br>
          
          <br>
          <h5>Main Menu - UI</h5><p><br>
          For the <strong>UI Design</strong> for my scenes, I really wanted to try out some <strong>pixel art</strong>, I had only tried pixel art once before in 2nd year and I hadn't done any since. I had found a 
          <strong>newfound admiration for pixel art</strong> at this point in time as I had been consuming a lot of <strong>pixel art content on Youtube</strong>, learning about it. I watched a few channels such as 
          <strong>Brandon James Greer, Saultoons, Overlord Pixel </strong>and a few others which all gave me massive inspiration. With some of their videos being tutorials I had learned a few things about 
          <strong>different techniques and colours</strong>  to have a basic understanding of pixel art.<br> With my small amount of recently learned knowledge, I began trying to <strong>create letters for the Main 
          Menu UI.</strong><br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/BeginUrJourney.jpg"><br>

          <br>
          Starting off with a very simple text style, I would create a <strong>box of pixels that was 5x12</strong> and then <strong>delete necessary pixels to create the letters</strong>, the 5x12 box ensured that the pixels 
          were <strong>uniformed in their size</strong>.
          Depending on how large I wanted the text to be would depend on the size of the box I would use for each letter, but I tried to keep the <strong>scale the same expanding from 5x12</strong>. I then began working on a button, which
          <strong>I changed from red to blue</strong> so that it would tie in more with the colour scheme of the office environment that I had created. This is also the reasoning that I made the <strong>background for my UI an off-yellow</strong>, 
          as it was similar to the <strong>walls of the office.</strong><br>
          These were the remaining pieces of UI that I created for the Main Menu.<br>

          <br> 
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/VisChancePix.jpg"><br>

          <br>
          This was the final result of the Main Menu.<br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/MainMenu.jpg"><br>

          <br>
          I played around with <strong>Opacity values</strong> as I didn't want the background to draw too much attention away from the menu or vice versa. I feel that the values that I chose in the end 
          <strong>complimented each other well.</strong><br>

          <br>
          <h5>Inspiration - My Level</h5><p>
          My level was inspired by <strong>halloween themed</strong> things and my <strong>cards</strong> were themed with <strong>Trick or Treat</strong> to fit the aesthetic.

          For the Mansion, like the Office in the Main Menu, I created a <strong>couple of moodboards to help me get some inspiration</strong> for how I was going to design it. One of the boards used <strong>old haunted looking mansions</strong> 
          from real life and the other focused more on <strong>small 3D dioramas of haunted mansions</strong>, to aid me in visualising and creating supporting models for the Haunted Mansion and it's environment. Again like the Office 
          scene, the Mansion would be low-poly to keep all of my scenes in the same style.<br>
          
          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/MansionMoodboard-001.jpg" style="width: 440px;"> <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/MansionMoodboard-002.jpg" style="width: 440px;"><br>

          <br>
          When concepting the Mansion, since it had helped me create my <strong>sprites for my Trick or Treat cards</strong>, I followed the same sort of process that I did for the Mansion as I did for them. I started with a 
          <strong>very rough sketch </strong> until I had a general idea that I was happy with, then I created a <strong>refined sihouette, then refined the linework</strong>, then I added simple <strong>colour and shading to 
          finish it off!</strong><br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/MansionTimeline.jpg"><br>

          <br>
          This was the final outcome of the Mansion Concept and then of my environment for my level in the project.<br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/MansionFinal.jpg"><img src="Images/VisibilityChance/Mansion-LightTest_002.jpg"><br>        

          <br>
          <h5>The Cards</h5><p><br>
          With the <strong>Halloween Aesthetic</strong> in mind for my level, I wanted to have <strong>Trick or Treat as my theme for the positive and negative card</strong>, perhaps having something scary on the 
          Trick card and sweets on the Treat card. I took to the website <strong>Lospec</strong>, which is an online pixel art tool, and I browsed for some <strong>colour palettes</strong> that other users had created and posted. 
          I found two which i really liked and felt they would suit my cards, <i>Carver6</i> by user <i>beachboogeyman</i> for my <strong>pumpkin basket</strong> and I used <i>Ghost Town Palette</i> by user <i>Kaiburn</i> for the 
          Trick card which I decided would be a <strong>ghost.</strong><br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/LospecGreen.jpg" style="width: 440px;"> <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/LospecOrange.jpg" style="width: 440px;"> <br>
          <i>Ghost and Bucket Palette</i> <br>

          <br>
          With these colour palettes I began to create the pixel art for the cards. From the <strong>videos I had watched I decided that 32x32 would be a good size</strong> for the pixel art on the cards, using a method I had seen to create
          pixel art which began with a <strong>silhouette, then line work, then colour and finally shading.</strong> This is the process that I used to create the <strong>Sprites for the Trick or Treat cards</strong>, using reference images to help with 
          <strong>shape and design.</strong><br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/GhostRef.jpg">&nbsp;<img src="Images/VisibilityChance/BucketRef.jpg"><br>
          <i>Ghost and Bucket Reference</i><br>

          <br>
          This was the creation process for the Ghost and Bucket.<br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/GhostTimeline.jpg" style="height:100px;">&nbsp;<img src="Images/VisibilityChance/BucketTimeline.jpg" style="height: 100px;"><br>

          <br>
          With my sprites finalised <strong>I moved onto creating the cards</strong> that they would be placed upon. For the shape and colour palette I followed the same process that I had done for the backdrop of the UI, <strong>having 2 tones of the same colour</strong>
         , having a more desaturated colour for the text to sit upon so that it would <strong>contrast against it and be legible.</strong><br>
          Originally, the base colour of the card that I chose was purple, as it is a <strong>colour that I associate with Halloween</strong> so it tied in with my theme. I created the Treat card first with the <strong>orange bucket</strong> and I felt it tied
          together nicely as they are also <strong>complimentary colours</strong>. However when I went on to create the Trick card, I quickly noticed that <strong>I wasn't feeling the mix of the 3 colours between orange, purple and green.</strong><br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/OriginalCardDesign.jpg" style="width: 400px"><br>
          
          <br>
          Since the <strong>Treat card</strong> was designed first, <strong>I really liked the simplicity of the card since it was just 2 colours</strong>, I believed that it tied in well with the low-poly style the rest of the project had so far. However when
          looking at the <strong>Trick card it seemed very noisy by comparison with it having 3 colours</strong>. After some thinking and some tinkering with different colours, <strong>I reworked the cards to be Monochromatic</strong>, this turned out much better
          than the original card design as it <strong>perfectly separated the Trick and Treat card</strong> from each other and also kept everything simple. This also allowed the player to <strong>quickly identify and separate</strong> the Trick cards from the Treat
          cards as well!<br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/TrickCard_002.jpg" style="height: 160px;"> <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/TreatCard_002.jpg" style="height: 160px;"><br>

          <br>
          For the back of the cards, <strong>using some reference images</strong> that I had found, I tried to recreate something <strong>detailed and nice that was still legible within the restricted pixel size</strong> of the card itself. I liked the idea 
          of having a <strong>decorative border for the edge</strong> of the card with some form of pattern. I was quite easily able to create a simple border and design for the centre of the card that I was happy with, however I had <strong>many iterations</strong>
           of trying to design a <strong>pattern for the card</strong>, but after many unsuccessful iterations I settled on a much more <strong>simplistic design</strong> that didn't take away from the centre or border of the card.<br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/CardBacks.jpg"><br>

          <br>
          <strong>As seen above,</strong> I tried to space out <strong>dots and dashes in different ways</strong> in order to create a nice design for the back, however I could never create one that was <strong>symmetrical</strong> or one that worked 
          well within the confines of the card's size, the spacing was always off. This is what led me to <strong>dialling the design back</strong> and decided to try and see what having small dashes for the back would look like. In the end it turned
          out a lot better than I had thought it would have and <strong>I realised I had been overcomplicating it.</strong><br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/CardFinal.jpg"><br>
          <i>This is the final outcome for the cards.</i><br>

          <h4>Unity Implementation</h4><br>            
                
          <br>
          <h5>The Arduino</h5><p>
          For the Arduino, we had originally planned to create it using a <strong>NFC Card Reader</strong> as that would tie in with our mechanics and visuals very well as <strong>both would feature cards.</strong> Since the first few weeks are spent learning
          what the project and brief will be through lessons, creating the idea for the game and mechanics comes after this, so the timescale for the actual project is quite short, maybe <strong>4 - 5 weeks in total</strong> and even then, every 
          student still has <strong>2 other larger projects to work on simultaneously.</strong> <br>
          With this short amount of time, when it came to <strong>coding and creating the Arduino Controller</strong>, a third year student and myself spent the better part of <strong>4 hours trying to get the card reader to work</strong> but to no avail. We had 
          to quickly think of <strong>another possible solution</strong> that would work with cards and <strong>fit the design of our project</strong> and that we would be able to get working quickly so we could work on other aspects of the project.<br>

          <br>
          <img src="Images/VisibilityChance/Arduino.jpg"><br>
          <i>This was our Arduino Controller.</i><br>

          <br>
          We decided to use <strong>2 Ultrasonic Sensors and coded it so that whenever there was a motion between 0-15cm it would send a True value to the respective card.</strong> This would then <strong>trigger the animation </strong>in the game, rotating 
          the chosen card around, showing if it was a <strong>good or bad card</strong> and then affect the <strong>Visibility Slider</strong> either positively or negatively based on the card that they chose.<br>
          <strong>LEDs were used</strong> on the board as well, to <strong>help give the player feedback on whether the choice was positive or negative</strong> by lighting up either a <strong>Green or Red</strong> LED to represent positive or negative 
          respectively. The button allowed the player to continue to the next set of cards and also move through to the next level whenever they were prompted to do so.<br>
          Since we were using motion sensors, we brought in actual <strong>playing cards</strong> as a sort of <strong>gimmick to help demonstrate</strong> what it would've looked like while using the NFC Card Reader while we showed a demo of the project to
          the other year groups.<br>

          <h4>Self-Reflection</h4><p>
          
          <br>
          Areas that I believe that I did well on during the process of this project;<br>
            
          <br>
          <li class="bullet list">The <strong>new style & technique that I developed</strong> during this project was with the <strong>Pixel Art process</strong>. Uses resources online to deepen my understanding of the style, I was really happy that I was able
            to <strong>learn about some of the techniques used</strong> for the creation process and that I was able to <strong>apply them directly to my work!</strong> The <strong>Silhouette technique</strong> for my pixel art was <strong>directly applicable to my concept work</strong>
             in general as a whole.<br>
          </li><br>
          
          <li class="bullet list">Working closely with one of the third year students, we were able to come up with <strong>alternate solutions when initial ideas failed </strong>which helped keep the group on track and 
            <strong>reach our deliverables for the deadline.</strong>
          </li><br>
    
        </p>

        <p>
          <br>
          These are some areas that I believe I could improve upon.<br>

          <br>
          <li class="bullet list">This was a <strong>difficult project</strong> when in terms of <strong>communication between the group members</strong>. Due to <strong>Covid and the on and off Lockdowns at the time</strong>, most of the work was 
            done online, <strong>communicating over discord mostly.</strong> 
            However with the way things were at the time, <strong>some students were not awake during day time hours</strong> and others were just <strong>quiet in general</strong> and we had no way of getting a response from them. Understandably 
            it was <strong>a hard time for everyone</strong> and it led to some difficulties with getting work done. But between <strong>myself and one other student,</strong> we got pretty much all of the work for the 
            <strong>coding and Arduino done between the two of us</strong> and allowed the others to <strong>submit their levels to us</strong> if 
            they wanted to. I feel that this was more just an <strong>unfortunate time more than anything,</strong> but I still feel that <strong>perhaps I didn't do enough to communicate with others</strong> at the time. 
            It has definitely <strong>opened my eyes to the importance of communication</strong> and I have since thought a lot upon how to improve on communicating with others.
