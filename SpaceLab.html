          <h3>Sci-Fi Laboratory</h3>
          <h4>Attempting to Model in a New Style</h4><br> 
  
          <p>
              Throughout the majority of 4th year, we were given the option to have a <strong>year long</strong> project. I decided to make a <strong>sci-fi laboratory</strong> environment as a challenge as I had 
              <strong>never</strong> modelled anything sci-fi before. In the beginning of this project I spent some time figuring out a <strong>suitable scope</strong> for the project and eventually completely dialled 
              everything back as I wanted to <strong>focus</strong> more on <strong>quality</strong> over quantity.<br>
              I spent a lot of time searching for images relating to the <strong>sci-fi aesthetic</strong> and began to plan out a project design and settle on what style of sci-fi that I was going to try and emulate. My reference images 
              helped me decide on attributes of the project such as <strong>style, location, lighting, colour</strong> and more.<br>
              
              <br>
              This project gave me the opportunity to attempt to model in a <strong>style</strong> that <strong>I wasn't comfortable with</strong> and had never tried to create before, I also took this time to learn how 
              to use <strong>substance painter</strong> to help me texture my models to a <strong>higher standard</strong>.<br>

                Typically, for my projects, they tend to be very <strong>modern</strong> in setting, or a couple of my projects from 1st and 2nd year were a bit more historical in setting, using <strong>castles</strong> and 
                more <strong>gothic aesthetics</strong>, but because of my strong interest in the <strong>Alien</strong> franchise it really spearheaded my interest in <strong>Sci-Fi</strong> for this project. Other media such 
                as; <strong>DOOM, Dead Space, Star Trek and Doctor Who</strong>, drove me towards making the environment that I created for this project.<br>

                <h5>The Colony</h5><br>
                <p>
                The initial project idea was to create the exterior of a <strong>Human Colony</strong> on an alien planet, which had been heavily inspired by the Alien Franchise, stretching from the <strong>Nostromo Space Ship</strong> 
                in <i><strong>Alien</strong> (1979)</i>,  to <strong>Hadley's Hope</strong> on Acheron LV-426 in <i><strong>Aliens</strong> (1986)</i>, to <strong>Freya's Prospect</strong> on BG386 in <i><strong>Aliens vs. Predator</strong> (Rebellion Developments)</i> in 2010, and lastly to Sevastapol found in 
                <i><strong>Alien: Isolation</strong> (Creative Assembly/Feral Interactive)</i> in 2014.<br>
                While I am <strong>not overly interested</strong> in most Sci-Fi genres, there is something about the Alien franchise that <strong>really grips me</strong>, the whole aesthetic of this universe really <strong>resonates</strong> 
                with me. However there were a lot of other inspiritations that I had gathered for my colony environment as well.<br>
  
                <br>

                <i>Reference Images gathered for both the Colony and the planet that it would be on.</i><br>
  
                <br>
                Personally I have always <strong>much preferred winter</strong> as a season over any of the others, I also prefer it to be <strong>cold and snowing</strong> than anything else, so this was probably the main reason that 
                I was leaning towards an <strong>icy blue planet</strong> for the colony to be on. It also meant that I could potentially play around with some particle effects and fog to have the colony potentially in a snowstorm for 
                one of the renders if I had the time to.<br>
  
                <br>

                <i>Early WIP Concept for a Colony Idea (Scrapped)</i><br>             
  
                <br>
                However due to the <strong>large volume of work</strong> needed for an entire colony, as well as the planet, I quickly decided that it would be <strong>near impossible</strong> for me to achieve a 
                <strong>high quality</strong> for this environment since I would also be working on <strong>multiple other projects</strong> throughout the year. This led me to take my initial idea and <strong>condense it</strong> down to a 
                more <strong>managable</strong> size. I downsized from an entire colony, to the interior of a small space ship and I planned out all of the rooms that I would need
                to model. This allowed me to <strong>remove excess</strong> if needed, planning ahead to best suit the time frame that I had for the project.<br>
                
                <br>
                <h5>The Spaceship</h5><br>
                <p>
                With scaling down the projects size, I began to focus my attention to the interior of Sci-Fi environments and began to <strong>gather supporting imagery</strong> that would help me design my own environment. I tried to collect a 
                broad range of styles, having a <strong>mix</strong> of very <strong>bright, clean</strong> hallways and rooms, to <strong>dark and grungey</strong> ones too, as I hadn't quite settled on what style I would rather go for.<br>
  
                <br>

                <i>Reference Images gathered for the interior of the ship.</i><br>
  
                <br>
                I'd never really considered all the types of rooms that would be on a spaceship, so I decided to <strong>create a list</strong> of what kind of <strong>rooms</strong> would be important for a smaller ship. The type 
                of ship that I was wanting to create would be some kind of <strong>adventuring/scavenger ship</strong>. One that perhaps kept an eye out for interesting planets or things out in space and would collect potentially 
                <strong>valuable items</strong>, or <strong>collect samples</strong> of different things to research. With a main goal of <strong>selling</strong> whatever things they came across.<br>
                
                <br>

                <i>A list of different rooms that I had compiled for my Spaceship.</i><br>
  
                <br>
                Originally I had a list of around <strong>15 rooms</strong>, all that would require separate models. I had planned to follow a <strong>similar structure</strong> to my <strong>dissertation project</strong>, which 
                was <strong>focus on one</strong> room at a time and <strong>add or remove</strong> rooms from my environment depending on how my <strong>progress was going</strong>. Since I was taking this approach from my 
                dissertation, I also began to think about the <strong>inclusion</strong> of the <strong>Environmental Storytelling</strong>, since it was such a big part of what I was thinking about most days. With the focus of the environment being inside a 
                small spaceship, I believed that I would be about to create more detailed environments and tell a story about the crew of the ship.<br>
                
                <br>
                <h5>Environmental Storytelling</h5><br>
                <img src="Images/Lab/ES-Examples.jpg" alt="Environmental Storytelling Analysis"><br>
                <p>
                <i>Some examples of Environmental Storytelling in games I found and analysed.</i><br>
                
                <br>
                With the examples gathered above, all of them had been from games that I had played at some point and had scenes that <strong>really stuck out</strong> to me, I took the time to <strong>understand why</strong>
                these specific scenes were so <strong>memorable</strong> to me. Using information that I had researched in my Dissertation, I used a few questions to help me work out the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of each 
                example. These questions were, <strong>"Is the example effective visually?", "How does 
                  it affect the narrative?", "How does it make the player feel?"</strong> & finally <strong>"Does it change the way that the game is played going forward?".</strong><br>
  
                <br>
                Looking at the examples and my <strong>analysing</strong> of them, I was able to use this to help me begin to plan out <strong>what kind of environmental storytelling elements</strong> I could use to 
                <strong>help convey a story</strong> to an audience. I began to plan
                out a rough short story idea of an event that happened on the ship and how I would tell this story using <strong>visual information</strong> only. So that I wasn't spreading myself completely thin, with my 
                extensive list of potential rooms I began with <strong>making 2 rooms</strong> and connecting them with a corridor to see how it worked out. I began concepting and blocking the <strong>Laboratory
                </strong>, the <strong>Bridge</strong> and the <strong>Corridor</strong> for the ship and the potential storytelling elements within them.<br>
  
                <br>

                <i>Blocking for the Corridor.</i><br>
  
                <br>
                With the <strong>narrative</strong> that I wanted to <strong>convey through the environment,</strong> with one of the rooms being a <strong>Research Lab</strong>, I had planned for their to be some kind of <strong>containment cell</strong>,
                 where <strong>something was being held</strong>, dormant. Only for it to break out at somepoint and <strong>attack the people</strong> in the room before breaking out of the lab and making it's way through the spaceship.<br>
                Using objects in the environment, such as a whiteboard, to show some notes about the specimen and also have other rooms <strong>support this narrative</strong> by having <strong>visual clues</strong> about the people on the 
                ship recently landing on a planet and finding these creatures.<br>
                For example, in the hangar, the crew's <strong>spacesuits</strong> having <strong>fresh snow or dirt </strong> on them from the planet. Having a <strong>log sheet</strong> from a storage room to mention some kind of <strong>portable container</strong> 
                being taken out. Lots of things like this that would eventually <strong>tie everything together</strong>. The <strong>Lab</strong>  was intended to be the <strong>final room</strong> that a viewer would reach and it would <strong>fill in the gaps in the 
                  story</strong>, left by all of the other rooms. With it's importance in my narrative, the <strong>Lab</strong> became the <strong>focal point</strong> of the <strong>entire project.</strong><br>
                
                <br>
                <h5>The Lab</h5><br>
                <p>
                My <strong>initial plan</strong> for the <strong>Lab</strong>, was to create it in it's <strong>"clean"</strong>, <strong>undamaged</strong> form first, to <strong>help visualise</strong> the space accurately, <strong>before creating</strong> elements of storytelling 
                within the environment. After <strong>concepting and blocking</strong> out the room, I began to create some of the <strong>larger objects</strong> like the tables and shelves etc, before focusing on creating some objects that would help fill up the 
                desk space and help make the Lab <strong>feel</strong> like a <strong>real room</strong> that was currently being used by a group of people.<br>

                <i>Progress of the Lab over time.</i><br>
  
                <br>
                <strong>However</strong>, as I <strong>progressed</strong> with the environment, I became aware of <strong>my pc beginning to slow </strong>down a lot. And this problem never went away, making it increasingly difficult to continue modelling. At the time 
                I was unsure as to what the problem was so I decided that I would most likely have to <strong>stop modelling</strong> very soon and <strong>focus on other ways of improving my scene</strong>.<br>         
  
                <br>
                <h5>Substance Painter</h5><br>
                <p>
                I felt that if I could <strong>texture my environment to a higher quality</strong> than normal, it would be able to do some heavy lifting and help <strong>sell the environment as a real place</strong>. So, after finalising 
                my 3D models I then exported all my models individually from my scene and then <strong>imported them into Substance Painter</strong>. I had to spend some time <strong>learning the fundamentals</strong> of the software 
                before I could begin to texture my models as I had <strong>never used Substance Painter before</strong>.<br>

                <i>An Electrical Panel for to go on the Walls of the Environment.</i><br>
  
                <br>
                As it turned out, <strong>Adobe Substance 3D Painter</strong> has an <strong>abundance of tutorials and documentation</strong> on their website, so I was able to <strong>learn a lot</strong> of the basics quite easily after spending time 
                going through the resources that they had supplied. One of the first things that I had to do was <strong>prepare the models</strong> for Substance, sepearating out parts of my models into <strong>different UV tiles</strong>. 
                This was done by selecting all the objects from a texture set, then adding an Unwrap UVW modifier and then unpacking the UVs. As well as doing this, also breaking up the objects into sub-objects 
                with a <strong>clear and organised </strong>naming system made it very easy to break down my models to make them easy to texture in Substance.<br>
                
                <br>

                <i>A Hand Scanner for the door to the lab.</i><br>
                
                <br>
                I found substance to be a <strong>very intuitive software</strong> to use and it allowed me to have a <strong>high level of control</strong> over the textures on my models. With the use of <strong>Layering</strong> materials 
                I was able to blend them using masks to create <strong>Edge Wear</strong> on my models. Also being able to <strong>manually paint</strong> certain details like <strong>scratches, dirt and general wear and tear</strong> on 
                the models really helped to make it look like these objects were used by people.<br>
                For the most part, my experience with Substance went really well. However it wasn't without <strong>some hiccups along the way</strong>. There were a couple of times where the texture groups of the 
                models wouldn't appear the same in Substance as they did in 3DS Max.<br>

                <i>An example of texture grouping not translating accurately.</i><br>
  
                <br>
                Sometimes Substance would even have an <strong>extra material group</strong> that wasn't there in 3DS Max, other times it would <strong>add special characters</strong> to the file names of the textures that 
                were to be exported, this would then <strong>prevent the textures from exporting</strong>. However, <strong>I was able to fix</strong> most of these issues after looking into them and seeing if anyone else had 
                encountered them online.<br>

                Areas that I believe that I did well on during the process of this project<br>
  
                <br>
                <li class="bullet list">With all my projects, <strong>I always make the effort</strong> to try and <strong>learn a new style or technique</strong> to help develop my artistic skills within digital art. 
                  I was really happy that I was able to learn <strong>how to use Substance</strong> and that I was able to have <strong>another layer of quality</strong> on my objects. I really like the worn and 
                  dirty look that i was able to give to parts of my environment.<br>
                </li><br>
                
                <li class="bullet list">While my pc at the time did end up struggling with the amount of models I was making, I feel that I modelled my models <strong>very well and realistically</strong>. As <strong>always</strong> I 
                  strive to make sure <strong>all of my models</strong> are made to the <strong>best of my abilities</strong> with the <strong>same amount of care</strong> being put into each of them. I <strong>don't cut corners</strong> with my work.

                These are some areas that I believe I could improve upon.<br>
      
                <br>
                <li class="bullet list">Starting off, <strong>my biggest issue was scope</strong> and figuring out a <strong>solid concept</strong> that I was going to pursue for my final renders. I almost 
                  <strong>instantly knew what genre</strong> I wanted, however I wasn't sure what I wanted the environment to be. Initially I had been inspired by some of <strong>Aliens colony</strong> on other planets and also with the 
                  <strong>Calisto Protocol </strong>trailers recently releasing I started off <strong>way too large</strong>, wanting to create a colony on a frozen planet.<br> 
                  Eventually this was <strong>narrowed down to a spaceship</strong>, then down to just a <strong>couple of rooms</strong> from a space ship, to finally <strong>just a lab</strong>. Concept work for the 
                  bridge and somewhere else was done. However I never had the time to do any of it. If I hadn't wanted to create a such a <strong>highly realistic environment</strong>, I would have been able to 
                  <strong>create a few rooms</strong> and corridors connecting them. However since I was trying to model as <strong>accurately and realistically</strong> as I could it ate up a lot of my time, time that I 
                  did not have since I had spent quite a <strong>long time narrowing down my initial scope</strong>.<br>

                <li class="bullet list">This was also my first attempt at <strong>Hard Surface modelling</strong>, which I don't believe I was overly successful in. I know that they are of a <strong>low standard </strong>and 
                  <strong>can be improved</strong> and this is an area that 
                  I am going to <strong>practice and develop to improve</strong> my overall modelling ability. I am primarly talking about the <strong>walls, floors and wall separators</strong> that can be seen in the room.<br>
