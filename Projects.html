            <strong>HORROR NARRATIVE EXPERIENCE</strong><br>       
            <br>
            I have a very strong passion and interest in the Horror Genre and also in Environmental Storytelling. For my
            Honours project while studying at the Glasgow School of Art, I decided to combine these interests and have them be
            the focus for my Dissertation and then use the research gathered to create a supporting project that was informed by 
            the research and then use it for testing to help support my Literature Review in my Dissertation.<br>
            <br>
            My Dissertation was titled; "Can Environmental Storytelling be an Effective Tool in Horror Games?"<br>
            <br>
            Researching different techniques on how visual storytelling can be used effectively within games, I looked at how 
            they are typically used within horror games. From this information, I carefully designed a short Horror Experience that
            would allow me to test if the information gathered for my literature was effective in horror.<br>

            <strong>SCI-FI LABORATORY</strong><br>       
            <br>
            Up until the point of this project, I had never created a proper Sci-Fi environment before. I had recently been consuming more sci-fi media
            and also playing through Alien: Isolation at the time and it inspired me to try to create something out of my comfort zone. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            This project allowed me to try and create models in a different style from the way I was used to. It was just a different type of design for me
            that I hadn't really thought about before, both the time period and also the type of room. After researching, I realised that I wanted to create a more 
            grungey and lived in environment, as to me, it feels a bit more believable.
            <br>
            <br>
            During this project I began to learn how to use Substance Painter to help me texture my models in greater detail.

            <br>
            It has been some time since I created the Sci-Fi Lab and I always felt that I'd left it off in a place where I know it can be better. So right now I 
            am currently working on improving this project, to try and make it how I intially envisioned it to be.<br>

            <br> 
            I am taking the time to learn and practice Hard-Surface Modelling as well as reorganising the layout of the Lab in order to recreate it to a higher standard and to
            also be able to incorporate the environmental storytelling aspects that I had originally wished to create.<br>

            <br>
            This also gives me the opportunity to demonstrate the growth in my skills since this project that I have honed in my free time.<br>

            <strong>NEON CITY</strong><br>       
            <br>
            'Neon City' is a small diorama environment, set in the slightly near future in a part of a city. I created this project during my 3rd year at Glasgow School of Art,
            the main purpose of this project was to create a multiplayer tank game and implement multiple 'destructible' objects within the environment.
            The main inspirations of this project were <i>Batman: Arkham Knight (Rocksteady Studios)</i> with the aesthetics being inspired by the colour schemes from the movie
            <i>Nerve (2016)</i>.<br>
            <br>The brief for this project was to create a small multiplayer tank shooter game. For the vehicle design i was inspired by the vehicles in <i>Death Race (2008)</i>
            and then added a cyberpunk feel to it.<br>
            <br>
            For the destructible objects I learned how to use a plug-in called Tyflow which allowed me to have a node based workflow to create and control the destruction of
            the objects I desired.

            <strong>CABIN FEVER</strong><br>       
            <br>
            This project was a Diagonal Project, where students from both the Sound and Moving Image course and the Immersive Systems Design
            course were put in classes together to combine their skills. The classes and project spanned 6 weeks.<br>
            <br>
            The inspiration for this game came from it being created during Lockdown, hence the title, Cabin Fever, the aim was to escape the 
            small cabin by finding the keys. The player can interact with objects in the environment and most of them will tell the player something
            and a sound will be played. I created and recorded all the sounds using different objects in my house.
            <br>
            <br>
            I used this project as an oppurtunity to learn more about cloth modifiers and began to create bedsheets and pillows for the dormitory.

            <strong>RPD RECREATION</strong><br>       
            <br>
            This is a small personal project that i did as i wanted to practice creating a larger external scene to completion.<br>
            <br>
            I have such a strong love for the Resident Evil Franchise as a whole, I am really big fan of the games, the
            animated movies and shows as well as the lore and backstory in the RE: Universe.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
            With Resident Evil 2 Remake being one of my favourite games it made me want to recreate the exterior of the RPD for a couple of reasons.
            Those reasons being, the majority of my projects were interior scenes, I hadn't created a scene at night and also the number of cars in 
            the scene that I would have to model as well.<br>
            <br>
            While I would have fun recreating this project i would also be developing skills in modelling
            vehicles and also how to light an environment for a night time setting.

              This is a small personal project that I did to practice creating dirtier looking environments. This project was a bit experimental as I wanted to try and

              <br>
              I got really into the Saw Franchise through a friend and now it is one of my favourite
              horror movie franchises to watch. I love trying to figure out how to beat the traps and what the potential twists were going to be. I find that a really 
              fun aspect of Saw.

            <strong>ASYMMETRICAL VR HORROR</strong><br>       
            <br>
              During one of my lectures, I was inspired by one of the lecturers who was taking the class and was showing different mechanics we could try out for this project.
              I was really interested in the camera render textures, and this gave me the idea of trying to create an Asymmetrical 2-player Horror game where one player would be
              trying to explore a Labrynth in VR and the other would be sitting at a monitor and changing cameras and activating "scares" in an attempt to jump-scare the player 
              in Virtual Reality.<br>
              <br>
              Since coding had never really been my main focus for projects, most of the time I spend working on the 3D modelling side, I finally decided to push myself more towards
              the coding side for this project as I thought this would be a fun idea to experiment with! I also spent some time getting better at using Unity's particle system to create
              different effects to try and scare the player.

            <strong>VISIBILITY CHANCE</strong><br>       
            <br>
            For this Vertical Project, our group was given the theme of the Games Industry for our project, which we created using Unity, Python
            and an Arduino Board as a Controller.<br>
            <br>
            We began thinking of Tycoon Games and how some of their mechanics work and how good and bad effects can occur to the players business
            much like situations in real life. So we decided to create a random chance game where the player would draw cards using the arduino Controller
            and their game would receive positive or negative feedback and either end up being a success, or a failure.<br>
           <br>
            Not long before this project I developed an appreciation for pixel art and the creation process behind different works. With each person in the 
            group creating their own level and only having a short time to create the entire project, I decided to use pixel art and low poly models in my
            level and began trying to learn how to create good looking pixel-art.<br>

            This was a Vertical Project that took place in my 3rd year of uni. For the brief of this project
            we had to design a game based off of a sub-genre that each group we given. We were given "Indie"
            as our theme and as a group settled on the idea of a Platformer with a Time-Trial element.<br>
            <br>
            For our game we also created an Arduino controller that would allow us to play the game. Using TinkerCAD to
            create drafts of how it would work, then actually making it and coding it with Python.<br>
            <br>
            This project was carried out during the Lockdown of Covid so as a group we had to make sure we found
            an effective way for us to communicate and keep track of our work. We used HacknPlan to devise sprints
            and spent most of our time communicating across discord and having bi-weekly meetings to discuss what our
            current progress and goals were.<br>

            I spent a lot of time learning & researching how to make a website. I began teaching myself html, js and css. I had
            briefly learned some things during school, but it had almost completely left my mind by this point.<br>
            <br>
            I took a lot of inspiration from Portfolio Websites I had come across during my research time and they inspired me 
            to create a way to show my work off and also tell people about myself in the process.<br>
